Problem statement: Build a deep learning model that can classify histopathology images as either cancerous or benign. This can act as a supporting tool to aid in diognosis and confirm primary healthcare specialist diagnoses.

Objectives: 
1. Train a CNN that can distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues.
2. Explore data augmentation to improve generalisation.
3. Apply transfer learning to compare with a custom CNN baseline.
4. Evaluate performance using metrics relevant to medical applications (precision, recall, F1, AUC).
5. Use Grad-CAM for interpretability â€” visualising the regions the model focuses on.
6. Summarise results in a Power BI or Tableau dashboard and a concise technical report.
